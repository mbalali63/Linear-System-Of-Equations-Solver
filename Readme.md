### Linear System Of Equations Solver ###

## Introduction ##
This code will solve any linear system of equation, with maximum number of equations of n=10.
We will use Gauss-Sidel method. The matrices will be saved in standard sparse matrxi formats.
The coefficients matrix must be given using an input file. the user will accept the default file name or writes the name of his/her file in the code input prompt.
The results will be written on the console, and also in an output file, including the coefficients matrix, the constant matrix and the results matrix. the output file will also include some more data, including the date and time of solution, how long it takes time to solve the system, the user name, and the method used for solution.



## Progress ##

2025-28-3:  
The initial revision, will be pushed. Initial implementation of the linear system, via struct, is completed. the gauss-sidel method is also implemented. Few improvments are required.
The prompts, must also be improved, in next revision.
